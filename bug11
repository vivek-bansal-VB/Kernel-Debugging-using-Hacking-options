BUG11: Priority linked list manipulation:
-------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIG_DEBUG_PI_LIST:

This option can be found under Kernel hacking-> Detect manipulation of priority linked list. In my case, I have made a priority linked list of 5 nodes.
I have given each node a different priority, where the lowest number corresponds to max priority and vice versa. The priority linked list has two lists , one is prio_list
and the other one is node_list. The prio_list cant have duplicates. Here  I am trying to manipulate the priority linked list by giving the existing node a same priority
as the head node without deleting the existing node. It shows me the error in dmesg that (this plist_check has been performed) when this option is enabled and doesnt show any message when it is disabled regarding plist check.

MESSAGE:
--------------

plist_chk_prev_nxt +0X45/0X60

HOW TO RUN?
----------

Now, once the above setup is ready. Now go to your CSE-506 folder, and do a make. This will generate all the ko file necessary. Then run this command: sh install_module.sh 11. 11 here is the argument; which signifies that this the bug11 (priority list manipulation detection). Now the sys_bug11 module is inserted in our kernel. Now trigger this system call by calling the xhw3 user space program by running ./xhw3 11. 11 is the argument passed here.

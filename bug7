BUG 7: System call is for checking stack corruption.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK:

This option is to check the stack corruption detected. I have made an infinite recursive
program. I have called this program from the main function , which calls itself and after that it tries to square the value and return it (not a tail recursion so the stack gets filled up). So , on running this program when the option is enabled, the stack due to infinite number of calls gets corrupted and the kernel panics giving the following message:

MESSAGE:
----------------------------------

end -kernel panic - corrupted stack end detected inside schduler.

HOW TO RUN?                                                                     
----------------------                                                                              
Now, once the above setup is ready. Now go to your CSE-506 folder, and do a make. This will generate all the ko file necessary. Then run this command: sh install_module.sh 7. 7 here is the argument; which signifies that this is the bug7 (stack corruption detection). Now the sys_bug7 module is inserted in our kernel. Now trigger this system call by calling the xhw3 user space program by running ./xhw3 7. 7 is the argument passed here.
